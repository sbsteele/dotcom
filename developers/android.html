			<p class="firstp">RayV Player SDK for Android is a set of native and Java libraries for developing Android players that can stream and display RayV based live TV channels. The SDK supports Android 2.2 or higher. It is recommended to use the SDK Android devices only since the Android emulators are usually too slow for the real time nature of the RayV SDK.</p>
