		<h3 class="subh1">Technology supporting high-performance HD video delivery needs.</h3>
		<h2>Faster Performance.  Reliable Delivery.  Unparalleled Quality.</h2>
		<div class="bodycopy">
			<p class="firstp"><strong>High Quality Delivery, Global Scale.</strong> RayV Optimized Cloud Streaming is our robust Telco-grade infrastructure specifically optimized for HDTV streaming over the open Internet.  Our distributed RayV Grid lets you broadcast content across multiple IP networks at unparalleled quality to millions of viewers globally.</p>
			<p class="firstp"><strong>Efficient, Flexible, and Reliable.</strong> RayV proprietary protocols with specific congestion control mechanisms and Priority Encoding Transmission techniques maximize network efficiency while optimizing throughput.  The use of additional nodes for multiplexing data in real-time alleviates the inherent problem in all asymmetric IP delivery infrastructures.</p>

					<p>By applying a hybrid model of secured RayV Nodes strategically spread worldwide with over 5 Million user nodes, we have created the first true global network with over 90% network efficiency. This enables us to:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Deliver at significant cost reduction compared to any other streaming solutions.</li>
						<li>Scale at 5% of the capital investment of any alternative (e.g. 1,000,000 incremental simultaneous viewers)</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div id="tab2" class="tab_content">
					<p>Our locality aware streaming creates a better user experience (less packet loss, more consistency) due to the ability to stream dynamically from local edges. This is true for the whole Grid as well as local cases within a LAN environment or a DSLAM unit.</p>
				</div>
				<div id="tab3" class="tab_content">
					<p>Due to the distributed nature of both our encoding and streaming, we are the only network ready and able to deploy thousands of HD channels to tens of millions of users.</p>
				</div>
				<div id="tab4" class="tab_content">
					<p>RayV is the ONLY distributed network broadcasting over the open internet in a managed fashion. Every single part of our network (including the 5 Millions nodes) is connected to our Grid Control Servers allowing us to apply network, quality, and business policies down to the level of the single user....Hence we are the only network that can Guarantee broadcast quality (HD consistent signal) at broadcast Scale (million of concurrent users) with a broadcast level of QoS, all done over the open internet.</p>
				</div>
				<div id="tab5" class="tab_content">
					<p>We provide HD quality video to any end user device across all networks.</p>
					<p>Our RayV Cloud Optimized Streaming engine is available on:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Set-top Boxes</li>
						<li>PC/Macâ€™s</li>
						<li>PS3</li>
						<li>iPad</li>
						<li>iPhone</li>
						<li>Android-based devices</li>
					</ul>
					<p>RayV also works with clients to integrate our streaming engine across multiple other devices not currently supported by RayV.</p>
