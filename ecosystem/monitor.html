		<p class=""><strong>RayV Channel Monitoring (RVCM) (“The Monitoring and Alerts Tool”)</strong><br>RVCM is RayV’s real-time live channel and stream quality monitoring system. RVCM’s Mosaic view and alert system, allows both RayV and our partners to fully control the quality of the streams and the user experience in real-time.
