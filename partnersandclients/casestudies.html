						<h2>America's Cup</h2>
						<div class="scrollimg"><img src="../images/screenshots/turnkey/AC.jpg" alt="screenshot" class="screenshot" /></div>
						<p>The city of Valencia, Spain was the host city for the 32nd Americas Cup held in 2007.  After much dispute between the teams about the rules for staging the next event, Valencia was awarded all media rights one month before the 33rd Americas Cup held in February, 2010.  With little time to organize traditional broadcast distribution, the organizers decided to implement a broadband-led strategy, offering live streaming of the races to audiences worldwide for free. Understanding that it had insufficient time to capitalize financially on the rights granted to it, Valencia’s mission was to set-up an infrastructure capable of managing a global broadband transmission in a very short time frame while having as many users as possible watching the live coverage of the race to serve as marketing and promotion vehicles for the next edition of the event.</p>
						<p>RayV responded within a two-week period to the requests of the city of Valencia. RayV Set up a real-time fully redundant VHO  within the city’s media center, and coverage of the two live races as well as press conferences and other ancillary content were streamed to over 500,000 users worldwide via the Americas Cup website and its syndication partners (including YouTube).</p>
